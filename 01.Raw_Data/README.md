# Folder description
Within this folder, you can find the raw data used for this analysis:

## 1.Genotypic_data_discovery_population_220_genotypes_ACGT_Format.csv.gz
Genotypic data for the 220 genotypes from the CENICAÑA's diverse panel. The file is in ACGT format and contains the genotypic data for a decaploid for the 19775 high quality SNPs. For details see the materials and methods section of the paper. The population structure is included in the file as Q1 to Q5
## 2.Genotypic_data_Validtaion_population_73_genotypes_ACGT_Format.csv 
Genotypic data for a set of 73 genotypes from the breeding pool of CENICAÑA. The file is in ACGT format and contains the genotypic data for a decaploid for the 19775 high quality SNPs. For details see the materials and methods section of the paper.
## 3.Map.csv 
File containing the list of markers with its chromosome, position, reference and alternative allele
## 4.Phenotypic_data_NUE_Low_High_N_Discovery.csv 
Phenotypic data for the NUE (DW / N content) for high and low N (NH4NO3) from the discovery population. In total there were only 211 genotypes with phenotypic data.
## 5.Phenotypic_data_NUE_Low_High_N_Validation.csv 
Phenotypic data for the NUE (DW / N content) for high and low N (NH4NO3) from the validation population. In total there were only 73 genotypes with phenotypic data.
